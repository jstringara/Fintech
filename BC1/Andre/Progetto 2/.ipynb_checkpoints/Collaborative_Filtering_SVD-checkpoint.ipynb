    "# Recommendation systems: using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)\n",
    "This is brief introduction to recommender systems based on collaborative filtering using SVD and its implementation in web page recommendation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "The web pages of the website of a financial institution are grouped according to their characteristics (e.g. tags) in certain categories, and for each of them and each user a measure is estimated that summarizes the Average Session on Page (average amount of time spent on a given page), the total number of sessions and other SEO metrics that measure the customer engagement.\n",
    "They are all normalized in [0,10].\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inv = Website pages on investments, KPI in [0,10]\n",
    "- Ins = Website pages on insurance products, KPI in [0,10]\n",
    "- ReE = Website pages on mortgages, loans, residential financial, KPI in [0,10]\n",

    "- MeM = Website pages with generic information, KPI in [0,10]\n",

    "## Goal\n",
    "The website is dynamic: a dynamic website is a website that displays different types of content every time a user views it, and this display changes depending on rules. \n",
    "The idea is: use the information at your disposal for creating a more tailored experience on the site. Based on a userâ€™s previous visit, or similar users' behaviors, a dynamic website can offer similar or related recommendations in terms of web pages, contents, etc. This is a job for a recommendation system.\n",

    "## Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "There are many techniques used for finding and recommending many suitable items (item = web page, in this case): **collaborative filtering through SVD is just one of those techniques**. It's very popular.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption of collaborative filtering is that people who have liked an item (a product, a web page, whatever) in the past will also like the same in future. Thus, this approach builds a model based on the past behaviour of users, finding an association between the users and the items. The model is then used to predict the item in which the user may be interested.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use SVD to discover relationship between items, and a recommender system can be build easily from this.\n",
    "Let's see how.\n",
    "Just like a number, say 30, can be decomposed as factors 30 = 2x5x3, a matrix can also be expressed as multiplication of some other matrices. But because matrices are arrays of numbers, they have their own rules of multiplication: SVD is a linear algebra technique to break down a matrix into the product of a few smaller matrices - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition, and https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.svd.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Briefly, SVD assumes a matrix of dimension users x items (which is called Utility Matrix) is decomposed as follows:\n",
    "                                   matrix = U*Sigma*V'\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, we are looking for the **latent variables, or latent factors**, that hide under the surface of the phenomenon we are analyzing (in this case, the use of web pages):\n",
    "- U represents the relationship between users and latent factors\n",
    "- S describes the strength of each latent factor\n",
    "- V describes the similarity between items and latent factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The latent factors here are **estimate** of the characteristics of the items: the SVD decreases the dimension of the utility matrix by extracting its latent factors. It maps each user and each item into a r-dimensional latent space. This mapping facilitates a clear representation of relationships between users and items. Then we will use cosine similarity to find the closest web pages and make a recommendation - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity."
